## Education & Professional Learning

***Centenary College***

**AALA, Business**



***Udacity***

**Nano-Degree, AI Programming with Python**



Completed hundreds of hours of self-training and coding while working for a computer retailer. From our experts and experience customers, I created a strong  base in foundational computing, networking, and systems theory — just as the PC revolution was hitting stride in Late-1984. 



*But here’s the real story:*

Karl began writing commercial code in 1985, at a time when most businesses didn’t even have an IT department — let alone structured architectures. He’s been hands-on through every era: from floppy disks to cloud-native microservices.

Over the years, he’s continued to grow through:

- Meetups and Technical Forums – Regular contributor and speaker at enterprise architecture and DevOps communities

- Industry Advisory Boards – Invited participant in expert panels for multiple SaaS and platform providers

- Beta Programs & Product Councils – Actively shaping the roadmaps of tools used in enterprise-scale transformation

This ongoing, in-the-field learning has made Karl a trusted voice in enterprise IT — not because of a framed degree, but because he’s been in the room (and in the code) since the beginning.
