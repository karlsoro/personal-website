## Design Guidelines

1. **Consistent Style**: All images should have a cohesive look and feel
2. **Abstract Representation**: Use abstract or symbolic representations rather than literal depictions
3. **Color Palette**: Use blues, grays, and whites to match the website theme
4. **Typography**: If text is included, use clean, modern fonts
5. **Composition**: Ensure the image works well as a card thumbnail

## Implementation Notes

The images are automatically selected based on blog post content using keyword matching. The system will:

1. Analyze the post title and content
2. Match keywords to appropriate images
3. Select a random image from matching options
4. Fall back to a random image if no matches are found

This ensures that blog posts have relevant, varied images while maintaining visual consistency.
