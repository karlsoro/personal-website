# Blog Cleanup Checkpoint - Resume Tomorrow

## 🎯 Current Situation

### ✅ What's Working:
- **API is healthy** and running
- **Basic blog endpoints** work: `GET /api/blog`, `GET /api/blog/:id`
- **8 total blog posts** identified
- **5 test posts** need cleanup
- **3 real blog posts** should be kept

### ❌ What's Not Working:
- **New management endpoints** (`GET /api/blog/all`, `DELETE /api/blog/test`) are not working
- **Route ordering fix** was pushed and deployed but endpoints still return errors
- **Blog management script** fails because `/all` endpoint doesn't work

## 📊 Test Posts to Clean Up:
```

6888080e04ef46dc1c620eb3 | test

## 🔧 Technical Issues Identified:

### Route Ordering Problem:
- `/all` and `/test` routes are being caught by `/:id` route
- Route fix was applied but not working in production
- Error messages suggest routes are hitting wrong handlers

### Files Modified:
- `backend/src/routes/blog.ts` - Route ordering fix applied
- `blog-management.sh` - Management script created (not working)
- `cleanup-test-posts.sh` - Alternative cleanup script created
- `BLOG_MANAGEMENT_GUIDE.md` - Documentation created

## 🚀 Immediate Solutions Available:

### Option 1: Azure Portal Data Explorer (Recommended)
1. Go to https://portal.azure.com
2. Search for "Cosmos DB" → find `ks-personal-website-cosmos`
3. Click "Data Explorer" in left menu
4. Navigate to database → `blogposts` collection
5. Delete the 5 test posts by ID

### Option 2: Fix Route Issue
- Investigate why route ordering fix didn't work
- Check for syntax errors or compilation issues
- Verify route registration in Express

## 📝 Commands to Resume:

```bash
# Test current API status
curl -s "https://ks-personal-website-api.grayflower-3fffbb5b.eastus2.azurecontainerapps.io/api/blog/all"

# List test posts (working)
curl -s "https://ks-personal-website-api.grayflower-3fffbb5b.eastus2.azurecontainerapps.io/api/blog?limit=1000" | jq -r '.data[] | "\(._id) | \(.title)"' | grep -i test

# Check if new endpoints are working
./blog-management.sh list
```

## 🎯 Priority for Tomorrow:

1. **Immediate**: Clean up test posts via Azure Portal Data Explorer
2. **Investigate**: Why route ordering fix didn't work despite deployment
3. **Fix**: Route registration issue or find alternative approach
4. **Test**: Verify blog management script works

## 🔍 Potential Root Causes:

1. **Route registration order** in Express
2. **Compilation/build issue** with TypeScript
3. **Caching issue** in Azure Container Apps
4. **APIM interference** with route handling
5. **Express middleware** affecting route matching

## 📋 Files to Check Tomorrow:

- `backend/src/routes/blog.ts` - Route definitions
- `backend/src/app.ts` - Route registration
- `backend/Dockerfile` - Build process
- GitHub Actions logs - Deployment issues

**Last Updated**: $(date)
**Status**: Paused - Route fix deployed but not working
**Next Action**: Clean up test posts via Azure Portal, then investigate route issue
